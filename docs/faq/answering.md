### How do I post an answer?

After logging in and picking a challenge to solve, click the _Write Answer_ button. Then, select the programming language you want to use and set the encoding. Axtell automatically fills the _Encoding_ field with the corresponding code page associated with the language, but you can change it manually if you need it to be set to something else. Then, fill the _Code_ section with your source code and optionally edit the _Commentary_. Just click _SUBMIT_ and you should be good to go.

### What if my language / encoding doesn't show up?

In case you couldn't find the language you wanted to participate with, make sure to fill out the [language proposal form](https://goo.gl/forms/rr7SuEYwjWSbG4Y63). Learn more about programming language support at [Languages FAQ](https://axtell.vihan.org/help/faq/languages).

### What is the _Commentary_ for?

This field can be used for various purposes, including but not limited to:

  - Adding an explanation of the algorithm used.
  - Adding links to online code testing services, such as [Try it Online!](https://tio.run/#).
  - Making general remarks about the program's capabilities (e.g. desired input-output format, using external packages, version or platform-specific features etc.)
  - Just about anything else that is relevant about the submission.
